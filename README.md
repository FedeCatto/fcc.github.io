### Sex-Related Differences in Toxicities caused by Treatment of Advanced Melanoma Patients
[Publication](https://osf.io/3t6fk/)

Extracted data from independent studies published until April 2024 with information regarding toxicity by sex. Only studies that involved patients with melanoma as the primary disease were included. Summary Odds Ratio estimates were obtained through random-effects models, and 95% Confidence Intervals were estimated. I^2 was used to evaluate the between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was investigated using Begg's and Egger's tests. All the statistical analisys were performed using R.

### Heart Failure Analysis

We conducted a data mining analysis in which several classification models were compared to find the best in terms of performance, including: MDA, Classification Trees, K-NN, Logistic Regression. The model we estimated after careful analysis, showed good fit to the test set and excellent prediction capabilities. Although the focus of model selection was primarily on the identification ability of the diseased, the model achieved excellent all-around performance.
